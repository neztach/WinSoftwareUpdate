    <## Checking what architecture your running
    # To Install visualcredist use vc_redist.x64.exe /install /quiet /norestart
    # Now we also need to verify that's the latest version and then download and install it if the latest version is not installed
    # When this is added no need to install Microsoft.VCLibs as it's included in the VisualCRedist
    # Don't have the time for it now but this will be added later#>
